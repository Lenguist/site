<h1 id="ai-project-ideas">AI project ideas</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Voice-to-code generator</li>
  <li>Sun path simulator (you supply website with a photo of a location, it produces a continuous animation of sun rising and moving through the sky)</li>
  <li>PRIVACY AS A SERVICE (this sounds amazing, although idk what it is supposed to mean)</li>
  <li>Essay shortener (inspired by common app. You put in an essay, the application compresses it to desired word limit with minimal loss of meaning)</li>
  <li>Podcast narrated about AI. Bonus points if the podcast is also about AI. Ultimate combo if the scripts are AI-generated too.</li>
  <li>Is Fourier transform a form.of low dimensional representation? (thatâ€™s more of a research topic)</li>
  <li>EMOJI THAT CAN BE BOUGHT (maybe like NFT art? if done right these can sell like crazy)</li>
  <li>Quantitative differences can produce categorical changes in outcome (epistemology/philosophy research idea)</li>
  <li>AI for tochki game (should be similar to GO, therefore doable, but also different enough to be interesting)</li>
  <li>Text editor that adapts to your stile (basically use AI and data collection to understand how you write)</li>
  <li>Too much freedom can be harmful (philosophy)</li>
  <li>Ethical anti-realism (philosophy)</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
