My name is Maksym Bondarenko, and I am an international student from Ukraine graduating from the Lawrenceville School in 2022. I am passionate about artificial intelligence and natural language processing, and I plan to major in computer science in college. I have been programming for a little over a year now, and I have found blogs and tutorials written by others to be incredibly helful in getting started with artificial intelligence and coding in general. I hope this blog can become that for someone else too!
