# AI project ideas

- Voice-to-code generator
- Sun path simulator (you supply website with a photo of a location, it produces a continuous animation of sun rising and moving through the sky)
- PRIVACY AS A SERVICE (this sounds amazing, although idk what it is supposed to mean)
- Essay shortener (inspired by common app. You put in an essay, the application compresses it to desired word limit with minimal loss of meaning)
- Podcast narrated about AI. Bonus points if the podcast is also about AI. Ultimate combo if the scripts are AI-generated too.
- Is Fourier transform a form.of low dimensional representation? (that's more of a research topic)
- EMOJI THAT CAN BE BOUGHT (maybe like NFT art? if done right these can sell like crazy)
- Quantitative differences can produce categorical changes in outcome (epistemology/philosophy research idea)
- AI for tochki game (should be similar to GO, therefore doable, but also different enough to be interesting)
- Text editor that adapts to your stile (basically use AI and data collection to understand how you write)
- Too much freedom can be harmful (philosophy)
- Ethical anti-realism (philosophy)
